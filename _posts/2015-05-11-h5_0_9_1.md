After a few months of (part-time) work I'm happy to announce the CRAN release of
**h5** - an R interace to the HDF5 library. It utilizes the HDF5 C++ API through
the excellent **Rcpp** package. Although the package is still under heavy 
development it is already covered by 200+ test cases and runs on all major 
platforms (Linux, OS X and, last but not least, Windows).
